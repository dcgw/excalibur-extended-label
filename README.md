# excalibur-extended-label

## Obsolete

As of excalibur v0.26, this library is obsolete.

As of excalibur v0.25, this library is only useful if you are using legacy
drawing. It will throw an exception if you are using the new drawing system
introduced in excalibur v0.25.

For excalibur v0.25 and above, you probably want to use
[excalibur-text](https://github.com/dcgw/excalibur-text) instead.
