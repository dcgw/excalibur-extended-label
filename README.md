# excalibur-extended-label

## Obsolete

As of excalibur v0.26, this library is obsolete.

As of excalibur v0.25, this library is only useful if you are using legacy
drawing. It will throw an exception if you are using the new drawing system
introduced in excalibur v0.25.

For excalibur v0.26 and above, and for excalibur v0.25 and above if you are
using the new drawing system, consider the following alternatives:

-   Support for text shadows and outlines is now built in to excalibur, see the
    corresponding fields in the `Font` class.
-   Support for multiline text is now built in to excalibur.
-   No alternative is known for automatically wrapping text.
